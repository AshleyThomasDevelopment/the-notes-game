## General info
Hopefully this makes you laugh and pull out a classic Arnold flick. 

## Screenshots

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* ES6
* jQuery - 3.5.1

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Color changing user interface.
* High scores and past scores
* A limit-break rewarding fast memory recall
* A difficulty mode - "Party Mode"
* "Party Mode" should activate all color changing elements, as well as "Arnold Mode"

To-do list:
* Improve mobile appearance.
* Refine and expand arnold sound-banks.
* Ensure color shifts during Party Mode or challenge conditions are different enough to clearly change.
* Color shift sometimes looks poor under the button's slight gloss effect.
* Potentially add alternate 90's kid soundbanks such as Mario, TNG, or FF7.
* Add a command-line only mode enabling Arnold NSFW sound-banks.

## Known Issues
* Upon enabling color changing functionality on the "Options" box, the "Color Reset" function can't access the "Options" box to complete the color reset. 
* Error in meter-fill-bar where multiple color change states occur simultaneously. Cannot reproduce!
* Can't get color square audio to stop playing on gameover. 
* Arnold span tag is too large, needs to be refactored as button and appropriate style applied throughout queries.
* Meter should reset at 999 to prevent display error.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

## Inspiration
I took Angela Yu's complete 2020 web development course. The first independent project was a memory game, we were asked to complete a final result as a challenge. I did not follow the directions - this is what I came up with.

Thanks for all the great memories Mr. Schwarzenegger!
